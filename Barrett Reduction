// Precomputation for Barrett reduction
// modulus: the modulus m
// K: A constant, usually twice the bit length of modulus for 64-bit operations.
//    e.g., if modulus is ~256 bits, K should be 512. For uint64_t, if modulus fits in 64 bits,
//    K should be 128 (twice 64). Or practically, K can be 64 for many situations.
//    For simplicity and typical use where m fits in uint64_t, we use K=64.
//    If your modulus is multi-limb, K needs to be scaled.
//    For a single uint64_t modulus, K should be large enough such that 2^K / m doesn't lose precision.
//    A common choice is K = 2 * bit_length(m). For uint64_t, this implies K=128, which needs
//    128-bit support (e.g. __int128_t or multi-limb arithmetic).
//    For simplicity here, we assume intermediate products fit in 128-bit if available,
//    or we might need to adjust K and shift amounts for smaller types.

// For single 64-bit limb modulus, let's use a simpler approach.
// Barrett reduction is more efficient for multi-limb numbers.
// For a single limb modulus, it's often combined with properties of the CPU's multiply-high instruction.
// Let's implement a standard Barrett reduction for single-limb that uses __int128_t for intermediates,
// if available. This is a common way to use it for 64-bit numbers.
